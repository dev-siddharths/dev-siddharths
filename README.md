**Hey there 👋**

I'm Siddharth, an aspiring Full-Stack Developer currently focused on building real-world projects and preparing for placements. I mainly work with React, JavaScript, Tailwind, and Node, and I'm improving step-by-step in frontend as well as backend, practicing layouts with tailwind and databases, expressjs in the backend.

I like creating things from scratch no copy/paste templates because I want to learn how things actually work. My projects are usually built while learning, debugging, breaking stuff, and fixing it again 😄

**What I Work On**

* MERN stack development (Frontend → Backend → Database)
* React apps with state management & clean component structure
* Using APIs (Axios / Fetch) and connecting frontend ↔ backend
* Learning MySQL, MongoDB, and SQL queries for interviews
* Creating beautiful User Interfaces using Tailwindcss


**Tech & Tools I Use**

* Frontend: React, JavaScript, Tailwind, Bootstrap
* Backend: Node.js, Express.js (learning stage)
* Database: MySQL, MongoDB
* Others: Git/GitHub, Render/Vercel for deployment
